# ArmyAircraftNotebook
A list of reports and other such findings on my research regarding the army aircraft notebook. I plan to include weekly reports of word documents that contain my recent findings and topics I'm currently diving into. I also plan to include sources/links that will lead to most of the information that I have included in regards to the topic. I also might end up writing up short papers to help myself keep track of each individual subtopic when it comes to picking apart the Army Aircraft Notebook. 
	
   Report #1:

   This week I began my studies by reading through the Army Aviation Magazine’s section dedicated to Army aircraft operations. As I reviewed the article, I realized there was a lot of terms on here I didn’t recognize so I decided to pick them apart one by one, leading us to the first term, AMPS & CAFRS interface. The AMPS stands for Aviation Mission Planning System, whereas the CAFRS stands for Centralized Aviation Flight Records System. AMPS is based on a lightweight and efficient workstation that automated aviation mission planning. This system is often used and favored due to the capabilities of being able to quickly adjust mission details and provide situational awareness. AMPS began it’s field usage in May 2017 in Fort Rucker, Alabama, now it’s currently being developed to being offered on the Windows 10 OS and also provide the user an improved tactical graphic editor tool. This tool offers a quad core processor, an improved GPU, 32 GB of RAM, and a quick and reliable SSD. Moving on to the CAFRS, it is important to note that this is a function of AMPS. It manages the training records and the flight records as well as providing decision making support based on outcomes belonging to these records. By tracking multiple flight related details CAFRS is capable of supporting risk assessment throughout the mission process. The next version, v4.0.3 is currently in development and it’s being created to better improve the Aircrew Training Folder overall capability and be able to automate the management of Aircrew Training Folder for future usage. 
	
   Report #2:
	
   As the week progressed, I continued researching primarily on my first set of articles published by the Army Aviation Magazine. I’ve been searching through the catalogue of the website in order to try and find past editions of the articles in an attempt to get a solid understanding of the history of the army aircraft notebook as a whole. While this idea undoubtedly led me to learning a lot more about aircrafts, I didn’t find as much about the ACN as I thought I would have, so I deemed what I learned to be a sort of background knowledge and started trying out a few other sites on the web. So, after scrapping together the last bits that I could find in the backlog and searching for websites related to them, I ended up finding a presentation dedicated to picking apart the entirety of aviation networks, including the ACN. Here the presentation broke down the ACN into 4 sections, Communication, Maintenance Processes, Forms/Records, and Aircraft Data. In this report, I’ll briefly go over the first two of these points. The communications portion handles how data is transmitted to the external systems of the aircraft this is referred to as JTDI, as well as parsing the aircraft’s data for the ACN, then finally it sends this parsed data into the JTDI. Lastly, the communication portion of ACN dedicated to a training portion known as MFOQA (Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance) programs designed for enhancing the maintenance operation safety training. Moving on, the Maintenance Processes, first we have the IETM (Interactive Electronic Technical Manual) which interacts with the displays and the updates of the software, which is followed up by the GSS analytic tool which interprets aircraft data for the IETM and MIS (Management Information Systems). It also handles smaller details such as specific tasks similar to that of an aircraft test flight calculator. 
	
   Report #3:
	
   Starting this week, I continued to study the Aviation Commonality presentation I found the week prior. To jump right into it, I’ll begin by discussing the Forms & Records (F&R) portion of ACN software. When it comes to F&R the first thing to know is it’s often referred to as the MIS, or Maintenance Information System. This system is responsible for recording the army maintenance management system (TAMMS) updates when regarding forms and data, as well as interactions between communications and notifications/updates for where data is being sent to and from. This portion of the software is where a user could find a directory dedicated to keeping up with the maintenance through records and other such records. As for the Aircraft Data, the last branch of the ACN software stations, it mainly handles data received from monitoring support devices. These can include but are not limited to, fault detection, troubleshooting, condition-based maintenance, and MFOQA initiatives. The most in-depth of these support devices would be of the condition-based maintenance, or CBM for short. CBM is responsible for improving operational availability and reduce the required maintenance so that the user/soldier doesn’t need to spend as much time on that process. This is done by making use of enhanced diagnostics, embedded sensors, prognostic equipment installation, and other such features included with the goal of minimizing the amount of work required by the user of the aircraft. With these features mentioned included in the aircraft, the amount of work required by the pilot is greatly reduced so they need not focus on busy work like tasks that would only take up precious time for the soldier. While many of the features mentioned in this report were based on organizational goals, these points are as important as any other part of the ACN as without this level of organization, the software would be an absolute mess.

   Report #4:
   
   In my last report, I discussed the points of the ACN’s software propriety points. Though this week I tried to focus more on how the ACN responds to other systems in the aircraft. I started by working on researching the wireless interaction between the ACN and the Combat Service Support Automated Information Systems Interface, also known as the CAISI. The purpose of the CAISI is to be able to properly provide the ACN with things like flight operations, production control, and overall quality control. This way, the ACN can receive a constant flow of information from the CAISI to the degree of it being able to be one of the main connection points from the militaries ground station back to the ACN software device in the aircraft. The CAISI is attached to a wide array of different devices and stations all dedicated to giving the ACN the best possible variety of options, features, and capabilities as far as it’s software can enable it. That’s one major reason why it’s vital for all these nodes of communication to be connected as they are, for the upmost care of security and clarity between the ground systems and the aircraft. The purpose of the CAISI is to act as a communications interface for information systems, CAISI has the capability to secure connections with relative ease and without the need of an expensive design. A CAISI normally is comprised of two radios and is dual-band frequency capable. While this design, as mentioned before, isn’t exactly as impressive as the ACN’s design, it’s the message being delivered that makes it so demanding and important. With this tool being used for data collection, the ACN can interpret the data transferred to it, with that being the case, it’s up to the ACN to make the most of it and ensure both a safe flight and monitor flight operations for the pilot, leaving the pilot with the least amount of work as possible due to this chain of communication mentioned prior. 
	
   Report #5: 
   
   This week my report focused primarily on learning more about a system that is closely related to the ACN, which is the Aviation Mission Planning Systems, or the AMPS for short. I briefly mentioned this system before when I went into detail on the four subsystems of the ACN’s software, but I didn’t get into the purpose and practices of the system. That is what I’ll be covering in this report. I found quite a lot of this information on the exhibit P-40 Budget Line document covering the financial supports regarding ACN, AMPS, and several other noteworthy designs. This document will be included in the source material page of the GitHub. The AMPS is dedicated to working alongside the ACN software systems, it is designed to support the pre-mission planning, this can include but is not limited to the route planning, communications planning, as well as aircraft configuration systems. These mission data forms are made into both physical and electronic formats. The electronic formats are the portion that is sent to ACN subsystems that process this kind of information so that it can be used in flight for both more confirmed security and an overall more informed experience as far as how the aircraft will handle the flight based on the data it has. As for the software side of the AMPS it is supports the FiteScene Software licenses, manages agreements and related engineering services. FiteScene is a digital mapping system that provides enhanced mapping systems that holds to high performance, dynamic elevation bandings, threat depiction, variable scaling, and symbology overlays. Moving to the hardware side, the AMPS hardware is noted to be replaced every 5 years to ensure there’s no faulty works or slowing systems during usage. More about both software and hardware for AMPS can be found in report 5.1 on the GitHub, where I have attempted to make a large-scale presentation of capabilities without constrictions of space requirements.
   
   Report #5.1: 

   This report will be dedicated to picking apart the ins and outs of the ACN and the AMPS as far as the allotted Exhibit P-40 Budget Line details. Starting with the ACN, the ACN is described as a program required for aviation maintenance activities and required documentation of airworthiness for the Army’s aircrafts. By using the four mentioned software systems mentioned in report 2 and 3, the ACN can reduce the number of manual entries and greatly increase the accuracy of the inputted data into these systems. The initial purpose of creating the ACN was to attempt to complete replace the obsolete Unit Level Logistics System that formerly was used for aviation devices and unmanned aircraft systems. Though the accomplishments of the ACN so far have been significant, the financial report below shows just how costly these proceedings come. (Note: numbers are representing millions.) 

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49965790/156760428-f8da1e05-8e56-4a76-ad2c-2837f7406dc0.png">

   You will notice by these numbers that the ACN is costing the Army primarily through its field training aspect. This shows just how much testing and frequent updates are made towards the ACN, whether it be new communication points from the ACN to other systems, new updates to one of the four major branches of the ACN software systems, or fine tunings required by army protocols to ensure all the systems are checked so that the aircraft will operate without any hitches. This is further backed up by the runner up on the overall costs seen on the table being the cost of system engineering reoccurring payments. It’s no surprise that this would be the second most expensive due to the constant upkeep the ACN requires to ensure that no bugs could ever risk an aircraft to malfunction due to a faulty system, not to mention, as seen in the 2020 Total section since the years prior to 2018, the year of 2020 has been the most expensive year when regarding the system engineering points. Though, aside from the system engineering, the overall reoccurring costs have heavily dropped off since years prior to 2019, where there is a drop off over 10 million. This is a sizable yet steady decrease in prices, yet there is a matter of correlation between the ACN’s financial reports and the AMPS’s financial reports, while both are declining over the last few years, AMPS’s drop offs are much more significant.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49965790/156760540-82a698ef-5455-4365-b8e5-018d98d82b4e.png">

   As seen above, unlike the previous table regarding the ACN’s financial details, the AMPS’s details are much more expensive. Yet they seem to follow an interesting lead of a steady drop off after the year of 2018. It shows that when regarding the Engineering Change Protocol (ECP) you’ll find that the years prior to 2018 had been spending roughly 112.3 million on a yearly basis but then when 2018 came around it had dropped down to 20.9 million, by 2020 it dropped to roughly 4.3 million. This drop is steady among the other reoccurring payments across the rest of the AMPS as the prior years’ of 2018 totals were 199 million versus the 2020 totals of 15.8 million. While both the AMPS and ACN systems are still in their incomplete stages, their overall spending is undeniably going down quite steadily on all their reoccurring payments. 
   With all this information pointed out, it’s shown that for some reason, the payments dedicated to these two systems are on the decline. Though I’ll be attempting to research and discover why these payments are going down so greatly, whether it be suggesting that the systems are reaching the end of their designs or if the funds are being redirected to other points of the same project. This is what I will be covering as a primary topic in report 6, though I will likely be diving into different statements past the one primarily used in this report. I believe with this information uncovered, I will have a much easier time piecing together not only the purpose and future of the ACN but also how much time and money is going into a system alike to this, as well as how this time is related to the ACN’s recognition on other systems alike to AMPS.


   Report #6:

   My initial goal for this report was to find out why the financial payments towards the ACN has gone downwards since 2019 in comparison to its prior years of spending’s. Though, with the limited information I have, considering most of it is unattainable due to classified information and such, I don’t believe I’ll be able to find anything directly correlated to what I was searching for. Though, with this being the case, I have discovered something new and interesting while I was trying to uncover the financial mystery, that being a new actor in the aviation network. This system is known as the Aviation Logistic Enterprise Platform (ALE-P), it is responsible for being the single logistics information hub for all of the army aviation projects and other works. There were originally more individual unmanned systems that were dedicated to being almost like buffers for helping the logistical functionalities of these other systems, though these systems have since been replaced by the ALE-P, which now serves as the only needed hub for logistical details. ALE-P constantly keeps a unit level connection with ACN to confirm key points such as airworthiness, contains the historical data for ACN aircraft reports, and gives said reports directly to the commander. This system is also in place in an attempt to lessen the number of manual entries made into the ACN reports and increase the overall number of automated inputs in the system as a whole, making less work for the engineers of the army supporting the ACN. While I am disappointed that I couldn’t learn more about why the ACN had such a significant financial cost spike from 2016 – 2019, I did uncover a new system which will undoubtfully help me build up the entire network as far as trying to fit together the entirety of the network of systems that the ACN works with as far as the big picture goes.
   
   Report #7:
   
   Whereas my last report covered a new actor in the widespread network of the army aircraft notebook, this report I will be discussing a topic I already reached before, though I’ve recently uncovered more points through searching through the Army’s website. This topic will primarily span across the ACN’s software side of operations. The division responsible for not only the ACN but also several other systems we have previously discussed including, yet not limited to, the AMPS. This organizations name is AMRDEC Software Engineering, their current goal is currently stated as working on the Global Combat Support System, or the GCSS for short. The significance of the GCSS for the Army is that it will be able to act as a leverage to make the ACN work better as far as the backend of the system software operates. My findings as far as what AMRDEC has stated publicly hasn’t included directly why this is the case, though my findings would suggest that the GCSS will bring along with it a backend interface update for other similarly designed software systems created by AMRDEC, such as the ACN. The AMRDEC’s software divisions chief, Mark Hand, makes an important point at the end of his presentation to the Army stating that the final delivery for this payload of a delivery for an unspecified date in 2022. Much of the work done by AMRDEC is revolving around doing work for different branches of the military, though they have expressed their greatest of enthusiasm reaching new heights working on the ACN and its related software. As of 2020, the software design company L3Harris has stated in an article that a massive goal for the Army aviation unit from 2020 and on is to attempt to improve the capabilities to read critical data more efficiently as well as creating a long term sustainability as far as the software design goes for the ACN and other similarly designed projects. 
   
   Report #8: 
   
   This week I started where I left off reading through the article created by the article created by the Army Aviation Magazine, combing through it and attempting to lift any further details on the ACN and its related details. One thing I should correct on my previous report that I recently discovered is that the article I’ve been combing was not created by L3Harris, it just has a section dedicated to the company alongside its goals in regard to the ACN. This article is still 92 pages so it’s rather full of information about the aviation systems and how they work together. I started my week by researching on the advances on the ACN and its similar systems to see how it manages its large amount of data, though the main conclusion I came up to was that they were working to keep most if not all data stored in online sources/cloud systems as in the past the Army had always stored its data in local silos. This not only presented trouble for security reasons but also made the data transfers have tedious extra steps. Moving on, I found another detail in this article I found greatly interesting as I mentioned something similar in my last report, the linkage between the GCSS-Army and the ACN. This linkage will be dedicated improving the overall data management for information systems that the ACN will be able to benefit from as before this transition, the amount of data the ACN would process daily would no doubt be daunting. With that being said, the information processing power of the GCSS will be more uniform with the army’s other services as well as having the following additions, it will have a singular reporting mechanism and it will also be able to report where specific needed parts are across any distance. For example, if the ACN was showing maintenance details and mentioned that it needed a specific part replaced, thanks to the linkage between it and the GCSS it would be able to pinpoint the exact storehouse in the base (or even in another base) that would have the required part. Overall, the GCSS would have a much wider capacity for handling the larger amount of data that the ACN has been exposed to as it has been developed further. 
   
   Report #9:
   
   In this report my main focus will be having the report act as a recap of the capabilities of the ACN and what it's able to manage:

Primary Objectives:

•	Provide its users software system capable of a supporting the needs of aviation pilots as well as make maintenance checks/requirements take both less time to process completely, and be an all in one process under the ACN software systems. Instead of needing to go through several different systems to complete its maintenance it is an all-inclusive check.

•	Contains a digital logbook that acts as a way to contain the information that is produced by the ACN running it’s required system software checklist. This way, the information can be reviewed and confirmed of its reported accuracy. 

•	Keeps records confirming whether the ACN can certify an aircraft’s airworthiness by checking the statistics of an aircraft by the ACN’s programmed requirements to guarantee said airworthiness. 

•	The ACN is also capable of offering digital maintenance training through its communication portion of the software. This software is able to use the MFOQA (described in report #2) to offer a program utilized for training the enhanced proceedings as far as the maintenance done by the ACN is concerned. 

•	The Notebook also has been reported to have an IETM (report #2) which can offer its user with a constant updating stream of data regarding its last updates and changes in its system. This way, the system can keep track of any faults, recent system diagnostics, updates, and other support functionalities. 

•	The ACN is responsible for sending its forms created by the system as far as training program outcomes as well as maintenance outcomes over to the Commander on a regular/expected basis. 

•	The system also is required to give maintenance to other systems in its vicinity by loading packet changes and other catalogue updates to the other services the ACN answers to. 

•	The ACN is also responsible for providing advice/assistance to it’s other maintenance system services as a way to keep the information flow as neat as possible, and without any errors across the maintenance platforms. 


Other Related Responsibilities:

•	In the last few years, the ACN has had its systems transferred into being a subsystem of the GCSS-A (which was introduced in Report #8). So now the ACN is needed to be not only compatible with the GCSS-A software system, but it also needs to continue to give its recorded data to the GCSS-A. 

•	While the ACN might be relied on for several different system upkeeps across the Army’s aviation branch, it is self-sufficient as far as its own assistance requirements go. 

   Report #10:
	
   This report’s primary goal is to list the main connecting points of different systems and connections across the outerweb of the ACN and its neighboring systems:

Responsibilities to other systems:

•	The ACN is responsible for maintenance and documentation, that’s been stated heavily from my research. With that being said, it’s no question that the Combat Service Support Automated Information Systems Interface (CAISI) would be heavily reliant on the documentation that the ACN contains regarding useful information based on the records system integrated into the ACN, things such as whether or not if an aircraft is airworthy as well as it’s last maintenance date can be essential for the CAISI Aircraft system.

•	The ACN is also responsible for assisting the AMPS, or the Aviation Mission Planning System. The system is dedicated to the ACN when it comes to pre-mission planning and certain intricate levels of functionality such as the interface and menus for the ACN’s interface option menus. This is an example of how the ACN relies on the AMPS according to the P-40 Budget Line Report. 

•	The ACN also is responsible for the ALE-P’s usage as it is an integrated system in the ACN. It is the primary directive that is responsible for minimizing the required amount of entries into the ACN, afterall the ACN’s purpose when it was first being designed was to reduce the amount of time and energy that was taken up by maintenance operators in the Army Aviation unit. With the ACN’s interaction with ALE-P, this reduction is a guarantee. 

•	Another system reliant on the ACN is the AESIP, or Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program Hub. This connection is responsible for the integration process that belongs to the GCSS-A’s (mentioned in report #9) ongoing process of integrating the ACN to be a parallel system to the GCSS-A. AESIP is basically the primary system that handles these types of integrations as they are rather common in the sense of attempting to reduce the number of obsolete/redundant systems. 

•	The TAMMS-A (The Army Maintenance Management System – Aviation) is an integrated logbook of the ACN that while can be separately used aside from the form of the integrated version containted in the ACN, it’s still heavily reliant on the maintance logging systems contained in the ACN software requirements. 

   Report #11:

Timeline of Events:

•	2011: ACN’s initial software integration and startup begins. 

•	2012: ACN continued software creation, design, integration, and testing. Found reports include support on the project from system engineers, logistics, and technical support from the army. 

•	2014: ANMP (Aviation Networks and Mission Planning) acts to prove that the ACN along with a few other systems can replace the now legacy system, STAMIS (Standard Army Management Information System).

•	2014 - 2016: What seems to be a budget form from early 2013 seems to suggest the ACN was in its early development stage after being first introduced in 2011, yet doesn’t have much information being presented past 2012, then the information available increases in 2017.

•	Mid - 2017: ACN Software Material released to the more systems past the initial developers.

•	Mid - 2017: AMPS begins it's integration testing of the ACN capabilities.

•	Late – 2017: ATO(Air Tasking Order) RMF(Risk Management Framework) Initialization; this was done first to act as a way to prep the ACN for it’s future usage with less risk to the other systems it will be integrated with.

•	Late 2017: UAS(Unmanned Aircraft System) Fielding; testing to confirm and plan the compatibilities of the UAS and ACN system properties.

•	Early – 2018: LLD(Layered Laser Defense) addition to the ACN workings

•	Mid – 2018: Rotary Wing Fielding Testings for the ACN integration; the start of working the ACN systems into the requirements/properties of aircraft systems. 

•	Early – 2019: UAS-I; integration between the ACN systems and the UAS. 

•	Mid – 2019: Fixed Wing Fielding; testing the systems of the fixed winged aircrafts and the ACN integration compatibility.

•	Mid – 2020: ULLS-A (Unit Leveled Logistics System – Aviation) compatibility tests and integration added to the system processes in the ACN.

•	Early – 2021: According to the P-40 Exhibit budget documents, the GCSS-A increment 1 was initially created to act as a campaign plan to introduce to army to a seamlessly flowing source of technology that’s reliable, accurate, accessible, and secure without fail. Though increment 1 is mostly focused on the land units, increment 2 is pointed out in the same document to offer a more aviation based tool. Thus, this increment doesn’t include the ACN , but I felt it vital to include before mentioning the increment 2. 

•	Early – 2022: Increment 2 begins being planned by the Army’s GCSS-A as a way to replace the now legacy systems of the army’s aviation units and replace them with the ACN and AWRDS (Army War Reserve Deployment System). This increment is built on the idea of offering the army’s air units a more secure and accurate information flow on the battlefield, so that combat is as smooth as possible.

•	Mid – 2021: The GCSS-A got permission to begin testing the ACN to begin releasing the tests of increment 2 wave 1 from the program director Officer Ross Guckert. 51,000 army personnel were presented with these new capabilities, as the testing process of the first wave. 

   o	Note: Increment 2 seems to be a bridging solution to a problem presented through the integration of the ACN into the Army’s Enterprise Business Systems. 

•	March 2022: The planned date (haven’t found confirmation if it went through) for the next wave of increment 2’s to be released.
