# ArmyAircraftNotebook
A list of reports and other such findings on my research regarding the army aircraft notebook. I plan to include weekly reports of word documents that contain my recent findings and topics I'm currently diving into. I also plan to include sources/links that will lead to most of the information that I have included in regards to the topic. I also might end up writing up short papers to help myself keep track of each individual subtopic when it comes to picking apart the Army Aircraft Notebook.
